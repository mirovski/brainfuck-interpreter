Project description/documentation:
This is basic brainfuck interpreter that supports
random numbers, but its compatible with classic
brainfuck so classic brainfuck programs can still
run here without  any problems. This is open-source
so you can edit this program and share it if you want.
This is written in 64-bit c++ (version 4.9.2). 
I use Dev-C++ 5.11 IDE for writing this program. List
of commands is following:

 *  + = increases current value

 *  - = decreases current value
 
 *  > = moves pointer to right side (next cell in
 *  list will be selected by pointer)

 *  < = does same thing as > command but it moves
 *  pointer to left side/previous cell in list
 *  will be selected by pointer

 *  . = prints character that have ascii value that
 *  is selected by pointer

 *  , = saves ascii value of entered character to
 *  memory

 *  [ = if current pointer value is zero program goes
 *  to command after next matching ] else it goes to
 *  next matching ]

 *  ] = if current pointer value is not zero program
 *  goes to previously matching [ else program ignores
 *  this command

 *  ? = this command does not exists in classic brainfuck
 *  but it exists in this or another interpreter/compiler
 *  when program reads this command it will put random
 *  number beetwen 0 and 255 in current pointer

 *  ! = this command also does not exist in classic brainfuck
 *  and this is command same as command ? command but its
 *  random number generated by seed, seed will be current
 *  pointer value

 *  ~ = this command does not exists in classic brainfuck,
 *  it clears console/makes console empty

 *  $ = this command does not exists in classic brainfuck,
 *  this command deletes only last character from output

 *  @ = this command also does not exists in classic
 *  brainfuck, it makes delay for miliseconds specified by
 *  pointer value
